# Rameses Scripting Language

## Overview

Rameses is a powerful, high-level scripting language designed for interactive applications, game development, and complex data manipulation. It provides a rich set of features for developers looking to create engaging experiences and efficient programs.

- **Functions and Procedures**: Modular programming with support for defining and invoking functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Built-in Libraries**: Provides standard libraries for common tasks, including math, string manipulation, I/O operations, and more.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling through try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.
